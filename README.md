"# UemyLinkedListPlaylistChallenge"

My solution to the Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers course unit Section 8 Chapter 119 LinkedList Challenge Exercise (Codign Exercise 46: Playlist).

The application simulates the functions of a music player:
- add records (artist, title, ArrayList of Songs) to an ArrayList of albums
- create a playlist of songs within a LinkedList
- simulate play functions of playlist: play, skip forward, skip backwards, and remove
